## [1.0.0](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/RepSearch/releases/tag/1.0.0) - 2024-10-03

### Changed

- Recoded the entire addon, now I just manipulate the update function of Blizzards ReputationFrame with an algorithm of my own.

- Searching for something now colors the part of the name of the faction you were searching for (e.g. searching for "War" colors the "War" part in "The War Within" green).
