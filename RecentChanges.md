## [1.0.1](https://github.com/NintendoLink07/RepSearch/releases/tag/1.0.1) - 2024-12-08

### Added

- Blizzard has limited the functionality of currency transfers when you have changed the currency list in any way (even when you haven't even touched anything and just refreshed the data).
A checkbox has been added that shows the current state of currency transfers:
If it's checked you can transfer currencies but you can't search for anything and the list is not ordered.
If it's unchecked currency transfers will produce a LUA error but you can search for currencies and the will be automatically ordered.
